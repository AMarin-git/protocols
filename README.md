This repository contains code for implementing protocols described in the quantum protocol zoo (http://wiki.veriqloud.fr). Starting with a few of them, they will be progressively added and enhanced in terms of robustness and usability.

The software stack used is based on python / simulaqron / cqc.

The master branch is tagged with release numbers that will be increasing in sequence with the software maturity.

We will be testing our release on the machines available to us. Thus some bugs might (will) slip through. Feel free to send bug reports / suggestions.

This repository contains code for implementing protocols described in
the quantum protocol zoo (http://wiki.veriqloud.fr). Starting with a
few of them, they will be progressively added and enhanced in terms of
robustness and usability.

The software stack used is based on python / simulaqron / cqc.

The master branch is tagged with release numbers that will be
increasing in sequence with the software maturity.

We will be testing our releases on the machines available to us. Thus
some bugs might (will) slip through. Feel free to send bug reports /
suggestions.

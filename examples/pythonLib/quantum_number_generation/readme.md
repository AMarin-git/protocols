We connect a node (Alice) and create a fresh qubit then apply a Hadamard gate.
After measuring the qubit, we repeat the process 10 times(in the for loop)and 
finally we create an empty list in order to saving the quantum numbers or coins 
and the quantum numbers/coins are printed in the screen

Note: Some resources say quantum random number generation for the process and some resources say quantum coin generation. 
Probably at this point they can think a coin has 2 parts: head or tail and the code return a list include just 1 and 0 like heads or tails 
so they say quantum coin generation. In my opinion quantum coin generation is a quantum money and 
I think it is more different process although it has some similar features. 
To prevent confussion, I explained here.
